## 4.0.0

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/danger/danger/compare/v3.6.0...v4.0.0)

Welcome to 4.0. This one comes with _only_ breaking changes. There are two of them.
They both change pretty fundamental behavior in Danger:

* Switch messaging's sticky to default to `false` - Bogren
* Move the `gitlab` gem into `danger-gitlab` - Orta

#### Sticky

The sticky one affects every Dangerfile. When we first introduced the feature, we wanted
to experiment with how people used it. Looks like in general, people are writing `sticky: false`
a lot in their Dangerfiles. Enough that it is worth going through the pain of migrating the change.

If you prefer the old behavior, you need to add `sticky: true` to the end of every call to
`warn`, `fail` and `message`. E.g. `message("Let's show something", sticky: true)`.

Otherwise, you can just remove `sticky: false` from the Dangerfile.

#### GitLab

We want to keep the dependency tree for Danger as small as possible for the majority of our users.
What this means is that we are moving the gitlab dependencies out into a separate gem. `danger-gitlab`.

This reduces the number of dependencies we have for the majority of Danger's users. We _love_ GitLab, I've
been super happy with their work, and we use GitLab for Danger.Systems. This is not a slight on the project.

However, as of 4.0. Anyone using Danger with GitLab will need to use `danger-gitlab` instead of `danger`. It will stay
in lock-step with the same major SemVer releases with Danger. That should be your only change.

  This adds a new object to the DSL, `bitbucket_cloud` which offers the same API as Bitbucket Server!

  Jenkins environment, and you should be good to go.

* Added `branch_for_base` and `branch_for_head` for GitLab. - K0nserv

## 3.2.0

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/danger/danger/compare/v3.1.1...v3.2.0)

* Added `file` and `line` optional parameters to methods on the messaging plugin - champo

 This means that if you'd like to comment specifically on a line in a file inside the diff, you
 can use an API like:

 ```ruby
 message("Please add your name to the CHANGELOG", file: "CHANGELOG.md", line: 4)
 ```

 If you are using GitHub (who are the only ones with an API that supports line comments) you
 will have the comments added inline. This makes changes to a lot of the logic inside the github
 API, so we'd love bug reports (or PRs! :D) on things like "I expected this comment to be deleted."

 On other platforms, it will ignore the `file` and `line` parameters.

* Add Bitbucket Server aka. Stash integration - heeaad

  This adds a new object to the DSL, `bitbucket_server` which offers the following API:

  ```ruby
  bitbucket_server.pr_title # The title of the Pull Request

  bitbucket_server.mr_body # The body text of the Pull Request

  bitbucket_server.mr_author # The username of the author of the Pull Request

  bitbucket_server.mr_labels # The labels assigned to the Pull Request

  bitbucket_server.branch_for_merge # The branch to which the PR is going to be merged into

  bitbucket_server.base_commit # The base commit to which the PR is going to be merged as a parent

  bitbucket_server.head_commit # The head commit to which the PR is requesting to be merged from

  bitbucket_server.mr_json # The hash that represents the PR's JSON

  bitbucket_server.html_link (paths: String or Array, full_path=true: Bool) # Returns a list of HTML anchors for a file, or files in the head repository.
  ```

* Deprecated `import_dangerfile(String)` in favor of `import_dangerfile(Hash)` - dblock

  The new `import_dangerfile` method supports loading Dangerfile from Github.

  ```ruby
  danger.import_dangerfile github: 'ruby-grape/danger'
  ```

  You can package a Dangerfile in a gem, add it to Gemfile and import it.

  ```ruby
  danger.import_dangerfile gem: 'ruby-grape-danger'
  ```

  Use a local path for testing Dangerfile changes.

  ```ruby
  danger.import_dangerfile path: '/Users/me/source/ruby-grape/danger'
  ```

  See [#504](https://github.com/danger/danger/pull/504) for details.

  This adds a new object to the DSL, `gitlab` which offers the following API:

  ```ruby
  gitlab.mr_title # The title of the Merge Request

  gitlab.mr_body # The body text of the Merge Request

  gitlab.mr_author # The username of the author of the Merge Request

  gitlab.mr_labels # The labels assigned to the Merge Request

  gitlab.branch_for_merge # The branch to which the MR is going to be merged into

  gitlab.base_commit # The base commit to which the MR is going to be merged as a parent

  gitlab.head_commit # The head commit to which the MR is requesting to be merged from

  gitlab.mr_json # The hash that represents the MR's JSON

  gitlab.api # Provides access to the GitLab API client used inside Danger

  gitlab.html_link (paths: String or Array, full_path=true: Bool) # Returns a list of HTML anchors for a file, or files in the head repository.
  ```

  A lot of thanks for the GitLab team also, who helped handle updates for one of our dependencies.

* Adapt CI Sources that support GitLab - k0nserv

* **BREAKING** Removes the implicit Dangerfile support. - orta

  The implicit support was a feature that would check for an `[org]/danger`
  repo, and automatically parse that Dangerfile. Think it was a bit too magic,
  and the only person who I know is using it, said they think it should have
  been this way from the start. I'm cool with this.

  To handle the replacement, we've added a new object to the DSL.
  This is the `danger` API. It has two responsibilities at the moment,
  downloading a Dangerfile:

  ```ruby
  danger.import_dangerfile = "artsy/danger"
  ```

  and importing local plugins:

  ```ruby
  danger.import_plugin [path_or_url]
  ```

  Which the astute may have remembered used to be the purview of `plugin.import`.
  Which is now removed, in favour of the `danger.import_plugin`. Think there's more
  space for improvement inside the context of `danger` than `plugin`.

  I also removed `plugin.download` - couldn't see a use for it inside a Dangerfile. Happy
  to change that, if it's being used it.

* Rename `DANGER_GITHUB_API_HOST` to `DANGER_GITHUB_API_BASE_URL`. - k0nserv
  Using `DANGER_GITHUB_API_HOST` is still supported to preserve backwards
  compatibility, but using `DANGER_GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` is encouraged.

Full list of changes:

```
# Git Stuff
modified_files -> git.modified_files
added_files -> git.added_files
deleted_files -> git.deleted_files
lines_of_code -> git.lines_of_code
deletions -> git.deletions
insertions -> git.insertions
commits -> git.commits

# GitHub Stuff
pr_title ->  github.pr_title
pr_body -> github.pr_body
pr_author -> github.pr_author
pr_labels -> github.pr_labels
branch_for_base -> github.branch_for_base
branch_for_head -> github.branch_for_head
base_commit -> github.base_commit
head_commit -> github.head_commit
env.request_source.pr_json -> github.pr_json
env.request_source.api -> github.api

# Importing Stuff
import -> plugin.import
```

The main reason for this is that we can support many code review APIs without having to fudge the Dangerfile DSL to make them conform to GitHub standards. This would mean a gitlab user could write `gitlab.mr_author` to access the author once [#229](https://github.com/danger/danger/pull/299) lands.

It also ensures that Danger's plugins are treated like external plugins. This means any work going into improving core plugins (via documentation or automation for example) will improve the upcoming plugin community.

I don't like breaking backwards compatibility. Sorry, for as far as I can see at this point, this is the only one Danger needs.

* add `pr_diff` exposing the unified diff for the PR to the GitHub plugin - champo
* Improvements to the linter and the JSON output for plugin docs - orta
* Add `html_link` to the GitHub plugin - marcelofabri
